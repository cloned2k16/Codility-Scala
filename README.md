#### SCALA

*  1.1<pre>      [BinaryGap                    ]</pre>   (https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingY5A3ZP-VH4/)
* 13.2<pre>      [Ladder                       ]</pre>   (https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingBXK3ZA-ED7/)


let´s improove it by using Stream,  

* 13.2<pre>      [Ladder                       ]</pre>  (https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingQNU2ZY-EJP/)

so.. nice and elegant code but quite inefficient ...  
;)
unless you do it right, isn't ¿? ... 

* 13.2<pre>      [Ladder                       ]</pre>  (https://app.codility.com/demo/results/training2Y54KB-JXG/)

well... still not enough :D

#### so ... the point here is ..  
you better be careful with any shining syntax code,  
because more often than not, it hides you the actual complexity at runtime ...  
that's why efficient coding looks almost always like a crap ...  


#### so keeping the more efficient version let's make it robust and resilient as follow ...
